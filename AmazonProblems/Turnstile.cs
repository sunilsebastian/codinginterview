//Explanation:
//At time 0, customer 0 and 1 want to pass through the turnstile.Customer 0 wants to enter the store and customer 1 wants to exit the store.The turnstile was not used in the previous second, so the priority is on the side of the customer 1
//At time 1, customers 0 and 2 want to pass through the turnstile. Customer 2 wants to exit the store and at the previous second the turnstile was used as an exit, so the customer `2 passes through the turnstile.
//At time 2, customer 0 passes through the turnstile.
//At time 5, customer 3 passes through the turnstile.

Full Binary Tree A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree. 
We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.

                   /  \
                 100   40

In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
       L = I + 1 .Here it is 2+1 =3 


Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
